### Sales

- Reached out to several marketing agencies to set up intro calls

- Asked around for [marketing agency recommendations](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-to-find-a-marketing-agency-for-an-indie-business-7773e36e9e)
- Evaluated how many customers purchase AC adaptors
  - I unbundled AC adaptors from TinyPilot a few weeks ago since the PoE model doesn't strictly need it, and some customers don't want an extra one.
  - I did a two-week review to see if we should keep the change.
  - For the non-PoE version, we sold 23% without an AC adaptor
  - For the PoE version, we sold 48% without the AC adaptor
  - It seems like customers do have preferences, so we're going to keep it unbundled and give customers the option.

## [Talk to Stan](https://talktostan.com)

_Talk to Stan is a tool I'm working on that will respond to templated emails I get from spammy marketers and recruiters with a sequence of templated responses to ask the spammers an endless series of dumb questions._

- Added a new matcher for guest post spam

## [PicoShare](https://pico.rocks)

_PicoShare is a minimalist web-based file sharing tool I’m working on. I’m often frustrated that I can’t just send someone a link directly to a file because every file-sharing service tries to re-encode images/video or wrap their own viewer around other files, so I’m making a simple self-hostable tool that lets you upload files and share them with other people._

- Continued working on the [guest uploads feature](https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare/pull/150)
  - The guest links now persist in SQLite instead of the dummy in-memory implementation I had before

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Continued writing my article about my TrueNAS server build
- Added [3-month trailing profit](https://github.com/mtlynch/mtlynch.io/pull/903) to my retro graphs
  - [Screenshot](AWX3.webp)
- [Added prettier to the build](https://github.com/mtlynch/mtlynch.io/pull/897) to format HTML
- Removed some unused code I inherited from the theme I'm using:
  - <https://github.com/mtlynch/mtlynch.io/pull/898>
  - <https://github.com/mtlynch/mtlynch.io/pull/899>
