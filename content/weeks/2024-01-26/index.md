## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com)

### Management

- Gathered financial reports for TinyPilot.
- Had three 1:1s.

### Software development

- Weighed in on dev work to handle redirects after login.
- Deferred work on license key checking and shuffled around tasks to replace it
- Reviewed change to [location of libwebsockets license URL](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/pull/1727)
- Upgraded Node.js version on website

### Customer support

- Updated a couple of support pages to avoid hardcoding `C:` in Windows instructions.
- Deleted some old versions of product instructions
  - Last time I tried this, a week later, a customer emailed me saying they just got around to opening their box from two years ago and wanted to know where the instructions were, so hopefully everyone from 2020-2021 has completed their initial setup.

### Sales

- Joined customer outreach call
- Reviewed [TinyPilot vs. Raritan comparison page](https://tinypilotkvm.com/raritan-dominion-alternative)

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Continued working on year 6 review post

## Misc

- Set up AirGradient ONE
  - Hardware works pretty well, but I found the software and documentation really disappointing
  - I made [lots of software changes](https://github.com/mtlynch/airgradient-arduino/tree/008b777fa9b8c6ab78d8fd0b2790ad18aea93244/examples/ONE_V9)
