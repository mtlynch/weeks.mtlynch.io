## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

  - It did well on [/r/homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/j64za2/building_a_homelab_vm_server/).
  - In browsing for other homelab blogs, I found another sub that I'd never seen before, [/r/homeserver](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeServer/comments/j7eiuo/my_home_vm_server_for_software_development/), where my post received an even better response.
- Published my [September 2020 retrospective](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2020/10/).
