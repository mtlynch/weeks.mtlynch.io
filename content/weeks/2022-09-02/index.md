## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com)

### Management

- Team lunch with local staff
- 1:1 with new support engineer
- Sync meeting with EE partner
- Hiring
  - Following up with all the candidates I haven't responded to yet to let them know they're either not a match or that they were a match and I got too many applications to evaluate everyone
  - I closed hiring a week ago, but I'm still following up with everyone
- Adjusted my business liability insurance to comply with Amazon's new requirements
  - I need to have $1M in coverage per incident and name Amazon as an additional insured
- Wrote internal documentation establishing which holidays TinyPilot observes

### Software development

- Weighed in on design decisions for update overhaul
- Added [a privacy policy](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/pull/1096) to the TinyPilot web app's about page
- [Adjusted responsive behavior](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/pull/1092) for the remote screen to leave less unused space
- Reviewed changes to add JSON+LD data to TinyPilot landing page
- Removed incorrect accessibility attributes from alert boxes on the TinyPilot website
  - I'd been adding `role="alert"` to callout boxes that are permanently on the page, but that's apparently not the correct because screen readers [treat that as content the reader should see immediately](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/alert_role)

### Customer support

- Reviewed a new FAQ article: [Can anyone detect when I'm using TinyPilot?](https://tinypilotkvm.com/faq/target-detect-tinypilot)
- Wrote a style guide for content on the TinyPilot website
- Wrote internal documentation for conventions for taking screenshots
- Wrote internal documentation for handling feature requests
- Wrote internal documentation on how TinyPilot support engineers balance their various responsibilities

### Sales

- Increased Voyager 2 price by $10
  - We're selling slightly too fast to meet demand at our current rates.

## [Talk to Stan](https://talktostan.com)

_Talk to Stan is a tool I'm working on that will respond to templated emails I get from spammy marketers and recruiters with a sequence of templated responses to ask the spammers an endless series of dumb questions._

- Continue migrating to database-backed dynamic responses instead of having everything hardcoded into the binary
- Improve threading emails that have incorrect headers
- Improve name detection
- Add more guest post responses

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Started August retrospective

## Misc

- Tried out a new Instant Pot for the first time
  - Makes hard boiled eggs really well, super easy to peel
- Made white bean stew
- Sous vided a steak
  - I need more practice with this, as it doesn't work quite the same way as my other sous vide
- Gave away old laptop on Buy Nothing
- Gave away cast iron skillet we never use anymore
- Gave away colanders we never use anymore
- Decided on shrubs for our yard
