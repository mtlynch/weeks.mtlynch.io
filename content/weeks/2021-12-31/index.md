## Misc

- Did my seasonal swap of regular tires for snow tires on my car
- Became a paid subscriber to several podcasts
  - Several of my favorite podcasts have switched to Spotify-exclusive. I refused to follow them to Spotify because I feel like binding podcasts to specific platforms is a big step backward.
  - I realized I don't have much standing to complain, given that I've probably never paid for a podcast, and I skip through commercials, so I'm now a paying subscriber to the podcasts that accept membership.
  - Nice perk: no ads.
- Bought N95 masks
