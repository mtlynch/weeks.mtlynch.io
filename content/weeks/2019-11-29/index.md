_Short week due to Thanksgiving_

## New project research

- Compiled a list of all the local machine shops that match my criteria
- Visited two of them
- Had a short meeting with VP of one company, scheduled follow-up meeting for next week
- Researched CRM solutions
  - Couldn't find anything.
  - I'm looking for something that just lets me track meetings I have with different companies
  - Most solutions have lots of complicated stuff with scheduling and sales projections, which I don't need
  - The closest match is [Monica](https://www.monicahq.com/), but it's more optimized for personal relationships.
  - For now, just keeping everything in a paper pad and Google Drive

## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Removed meal plans from the navigation bar
  - They're still linked from a blog post, but I'm writing them off as a failed experiment. I'll maybe bring them back for the new year.
- Added a site [mission statement](https://isitketo.org/mission/)
  - This is an experiment to see how interested people are in delving deeper into the site as opposed to just getting their answer and leaving
- Added [Recently Added Foods](0FGniLv.webp) to the homepage
  - This is an experiment to see whether this helps people perceive the site as "fresher" or if it gets Google to index new articles faster.

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Wrote a [hacky Python script](https://github.com/mtlynch/make-mtlynch-stats) to automatically generate Markdown tables for my monthly retros
  - It turned out that I had been making lots of little arithmetic errors doing them by hand, so I [fixed them for the last 6 months](https://github.com/mtlynch/mtlynch.io/pull/473).

## [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com)

- Started work on a new view that allows you to view work on a single project
  - [Preview](aS0CI0T.webp)

## [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

- Added "packs" as a unit of measure

## Misc

- Created a [mailing list](https://tinyletter.com/indiehackers-wmass) for Indie Hackers Western Mass meetup announcements
- Scheduled the next [Indie Hackers Western Mass meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nerdsummit/events/266782643/)
- Gave more feedback on a friend's grad school essays

## [Dusty VCR Podcast](https://dustyvcr.com)
