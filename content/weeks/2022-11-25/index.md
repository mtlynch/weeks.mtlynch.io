_Short week due to holidays_

## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com)

### Management

- One 1:1
- Worked on an internal style guide
  - We had one that covered how we talked to customers, but I realized we needed a separate guide that covers writing we do in public, like in blog posts or FAQ articles.
- Continued a silly dispute with a company that overbilled me for a 3D printer.
- Reviewed vendor expenses.
  - Documented the process so that I can delegate this next time.

### Software development

- Continued work on pulling logic [out of Ansible](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/ansible-role-tinypilot/pull/233) and [into the TinyPilot core repo](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/pull/1148)
  - I didn't know anything about Debian packaging when I started TinyPilot, and I've since learned that Debian packaging tools can do a better job at many of the things I'd been using Ansible for when installing TinyPilot

### Customer support

- Reviewed new FAQ article about [fixing a "No Signal" message](https://tinypilotkvm.com/faq/no-signal)
- Reviewed wiki post about tools for viewing EDIDs

### Misc

- Ordered screws/spacers for the next TinyPilot case prototype

## [ScreenJournal](https://thescreenjournal.com/)

_ScreenJournal is a new project I just started. The idea is basically Goodreads, but for TV and movies. Or letterboxd, but focused on small communities._

- Added [auto-complete of movie titles](https://github.com/mtlynch/screenjournal/pull/52)
  - [Screenshot](/2021-09-10/BpLn.webp)
- Registered a domain name
  - screenjournal.com was taken, so I did thescreenjournal.com
  - I have to wait for Sean Parker to [tell me how to fix it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEgk2v6KntY).

## [PicoShare](https://pico.rocks)

- [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare/pull/351) where copying an image from the browser and pasting it into PicoShare would paste the HTML instead of the image

## Misc

- Scheduled Western Mass indie founders meetup for December
