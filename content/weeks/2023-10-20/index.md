- I got so fed up with RapidAPI's terrible platform and 24% fees that I started evaluating alternative options.
- It's surprisingly hard to find a platform that offers both merchant of record service (so I'm not filing taxes in 50 states and 30 countries) and an option for collecting payments via metered billing
- The two main contenders are Paddle and LemonSqueezy
  - LemonSqueezy was easy to get up and running, but they make it hard for customers to see their bill or the service provider to see their revenue until after the billing period is over
  - Paddle is much more complicated than LemonSqueezy, but it seems like it might support the functionality I want a little better.

## Misc

- Co-hosted indie hackers Western Mass meetup
- Tried to set up a camera in my basement to better understand rodent activity in my basement
  - I first bought the Pi Camera NoIR 3, but it turns out that MotionEyeOS is only compatible with 1 and 2
  - I bought the Pi Camera NoIR 2, but then when I set everything up in my basement with the lights out and an IR light on, it could barely see anything
- Rebalanced investments to take advantage of tax loss harvesting
- Hired someone to rake leaves at my house
  - The first person agreed and then no-showed
  - I got a lot of incredulous responses when I advertised the job on my local Facebook group from people who felt like it was outrageous to ask someone to rake a lawn for $25/hr
- Learned to use the SmartSet software for my Kinesis keyboard
  - I still can't figure out how to use macros, as the software is kinda iffy
