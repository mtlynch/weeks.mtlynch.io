_Short week - patriotically giving myself Thursday and Friday off for 4th of July_

## [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com)

- Had my first call with a customer interested in adopting the Pro version for their team
- Submitted What Got Done to [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/what-got-done)
  - Pretty clunky process.
  - I tried submitting it last Friday but PH kept silently changing my launch to the subsequent day.
  - I finally just accepted it, but when it actually went live on Saturday, there was a [bug preventing users from upvoting it](https://twitter.com/czue/status/1144999606524219393) for half the day (thanks to @czue and @mubashariqbal for helping to get it fixed)
  - It ended the day in second-to-last position, but it did bring in some new users.
- Reached out to a user who posted a Product Hunt [community question](https://www.producthunt.com/ask/5354-what-are-the-best-tools-for-team-weekly-daily-updates) where the user seemed to be requesting a tool exactly like What Got Done
- Submitted What Got Done to [remote.tools](https://twitter.com/RemoteTools/status/1146288028429762560)
- Continued reaching out to new users with personalized emails (fewer responses this week than last)
- New users sign-ups continue at a steady rate of 3-8 per day.
