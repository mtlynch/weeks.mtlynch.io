### Management

- Hired a second support engineer
- Led monthly dev meeting
- 1:1 with staff
- Dropped off equipment with manufacturer for prototype case
- Trialed Toggl as a new time tracking tool for the team
  - It's designed more for agencies/consultancies
  - It's very hard to find time tracking software that isn't essentially bossware/spyware. As soon as the features brag about spying on which URLs your employees are viewing while on the clock, I'm out.
- Evaluated alternative vendors for fans
- Prepared inventory for my EU distributor's upcoming vacation

## [PicoShare](https://pico.rocks)

_PicoShare is a minimalist web-based file sharing tool I’m working on. I’m often frustrated that I can’t just send someone a link directly to a file because every file-sharing service tries to re-encode images/video or wrap their own viewer around other files, so I’m making a simple self-hostable tool that lets you upload files and share them with other people._

- Ported all of my end-to-end-tests [from Cypress to Playwright](https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare/pull/340)

## [Talk to Stan](https://talktostan.com)

_Talk to Stan is a tool I'm working on that will respond to templated emails I get from spammy marketers and recruiters with a sequence of templated responses to ask the spammers an endless series of dumb questions._

- Fixed a bug in response matching
