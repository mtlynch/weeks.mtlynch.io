## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Published ["A Simple Example of Calling an Elixir Library from Gleam"](https://mtlynch.io/notes/gleam-call-elixir/)
  - And updated it with feedback from Gleam's creator
- Changed my Hugo image shortcodes so that [images have borders by default](https://github.com/mtlynch/mtlynch.io/pull/1502)
- Updated to [Hugo 0.147.5](https://github.com/mtlynch/mtlynch.io/pull/1500)

## [Refactoring English](https://refactoringenglish.com)

- Converted "Plan a Path to Your Readers" to PDF
  - I originally published it with Hugo as a web sample chapter, and it's surprisingly difficult to convert from Hugo to Asciidoc
- Wrote automation for helping manage live events
  - Part of the friction discouraging me from creating them was all the hassle of creating event links and ical files manually, so I used an LLM to automate most of this.
- Tried to get Jitsi Meet running on my Oracle cloud VM
  - I could run it fine, but the default is just that it's totally open and anyone can create video calls on my server
  - I tried working with an LLM to enable authentication, but it kept going in circles on broken solutions

## Elixir / Phoenix exploration

- Got the default Phoenix LiveView app to run on my system
- Submitted [a small fix](https://github.com/wintermeyer/elixir-phoenix-ash/pull/60) to _An Elixir, Phoenix and Ash Beginner's Guide_
- Experimented with Phoenix and Elixir a bit

## Misc

- Did monthly bookkeeping
- Got a light replaced in my house
- Installed a cabinet lock for babyproofing
- Interviewed a new babysitter
