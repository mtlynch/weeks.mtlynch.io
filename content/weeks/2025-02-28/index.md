## [fusion](https://github.com/0x2E/fusion)

- Added [unit tests to the feed fetcher](https://github.com/0x2E/fusion/pull/65)

## [Dusty VCR](https://dustyvcr.com)

- Migrated podcast hosts
  - Anchor, our previous host, was acquired by Spotify, and Spotify stopped letting us upload new episodes unless we pointed our RSS feed at a Spotify-controlled domain
  - I switched to Libsyn, our old host, on a $5/mo plan, which seems to work fine for us. Migration was straightforward
- Published our [Clean Slate](https://dustyvcr.com/29-clean-slate/) episode
- Added a shell script for generating the episode images with the title overlays
  - I used to do this in Photoshop, but now that I use Nix, I can't do that easily. This way's actually better, but I was always too lazy to set it up.

## Misc

- Submitted a [wordword fix](https://github.com/fzakaria/fzakaria.com/pull/20) to fzakaria.com
- Updated my Woodpecker Nix config to record server metrics with Prometheus and graph them in a Grafana dashboard
