## [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

- Completed the USDA-matching feature
  - Now, when Zestful parses an ingredient, it attempts to [associate it with the best-match entry in the USDA food database](HTq9Ydw.webp).
  - The weakness now is coverage. I estimate that I can match about 61.25% of requests, weighted by frequency. I'd like to get this to 80+% coverage, but there's a long tail of possible ingredients, so each 5% gain in coverage is about an order of magnitude harder than the previous.
- Reached out to active customers to let them know the USDA-matching feature went live
- Reached out to a potential customer from Github
- Fixed a few hundred mislabeled training examples

## [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com)

- Had calls with two potential customers to interview them about status-sharing tools at their companies
- Sent cold emails to 6 potential customers requesting interviews
- Sent personalized welcome emails to five new users
- Upgraded to Cypress 3.4.0

## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Added AdSense display ads
  - I tried applying for AdSense twice before and kept getting rejected for strange reasons like "insufficient content" and "site under construction."
  - I haven't changed much since my last rejection, so I figured I'd just try again and it was approved!
- I'm liking AdSense much more than Ezoic
  - I think the difference is having a sense of control. I can choose which ads to exclude and where to place them.
- [Averaging around \$3/day](590Kr0w.webp) ($1.05 RPM) from AdSense, but it's only been four days, so we'll see where it settles.
- What it looks like
  - [Desktop](fsIhdGd.webp)
  - [Mobile](dkZKsTj.webp)
- Fixed some layout issues that cropped up with the new ad elements on the page
- Fixed some internal links that were either 404'ing or 301'ing
- Found a blogger who [recently cited Is It Keto](https://protectingyourpennies.com/2019/07/05/keto-bai-creamsicle-drink/), so I reached out to see if I could make Is It Keto more helpful for her blog
- Upgraded to Cypress 3.4.0

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Continued writing my post about hiring writers
  - Got lots of writers' block this week because it's much longer than my typical post
- Did my millionth reconfiguration of my Jekyll setup
  - Builds were taking 20-30s (i.e., every time I made an edit, it took ~30s to re-render the page)
  - New setup is: Jekyll runs on a VM that uses an SSD for storage. The VM exposes the blog directory as a Samba share, which I mount from Windows so that I can edit my posts comfortably in VS Code.

## Beekeeping

- Checked in on my bees' progress filling their honey supers
  - [They're building a little bit wacky off the frames](https://photos.app.goo.gl/u21SvJB7zBUrobVN9) but otherwise seem to be making good progress
- Tasted my bees' honey for the first time (it was amazing)

## [Dusty VCR](https://dustyvcr.com)

- Recorded episode #9

## Misc

- Helped my dad move
- [Got solar panels](https://photos.app.goo.gl/qehqJf6sVtqQvJbY8)!
  - Everything is set up, but I'm still awaiting final inspection before they can flip everything on
- Finally fixed the hinges on my porch screen door that had been broken for months
