## [Talk to Stan](https://talktostan.com)

## Misc

- Continued working on my 2021 taxes
  - I've been waiting months for progress from my accountants on a relatively simple tax return
- Set up a new laptop for my fiance
  - She'd been dragging along an 8-year old Dell whose battery life had shrunk to 1 hour, and it took 5 minutes to boot
  - It'll be an interesting experiment because she's always used Windows, but she only ever uses Chrome, so I set her up with a Dell and Ubuntu, but we'll migrate over her Windows license if she misses Windows
