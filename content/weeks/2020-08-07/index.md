## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com)

- Cleared the order backlog!
- Initiated conversations with design companies about a cleaner design for TinyPilot.
- Reviewed a [user-submitted PR](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/pull/113) to add clipboard paste functionality
- Answered customer support questions from new users.
  - Updated the blog post and installation instructions to try to prevent users from repeating mistakes.
- Set up eBay listings for non-US customers.
  - This was surprisingly hard!
  - I haven't created a new eBay account since I was 13 (shhh, don't tell eBay I had my personal account since age 13), so I didn't realize the hoops you have to jump through now.
  - I had to go through manual verification and they've capped me to $1,000 in sales per month.
  - But now these listings are up:
    - [Hobbyist kit](https://www.ebay.com/itm/TinyPilot-KVM-over-IP-Hobbyist-Kit/392899960085)
    - [Hacker kit](https://www.ebay.com/itm/TinyPilot-KVM-over-IP-Hacker-Kit/392899961801)
- Tweaked my assembly instructions to add clearer photos and more clarification about how to know things are working.
- Adjusted the color on the sales site logo
  - [Before](7JNk.webp)
  - [After](Nw1y.webp)
- Did some work to get TinyPilot [closer to working](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/pull/109) on non Raspberry Pi OS systems.
- [Fixed a UI bug](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/pull/110) in the web app.
- Added video demo to website.
- Added Twitter link to website.

## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Finally collected the money that a merchant was refusing to pay me.
  - Blog post to come.
- Began experimenting with a new affiliate.
- Applied and got approved for AdThrive, the fancy ad network that supposedly pays out substantially more than AdSense.
  - I've seen reports that it's 2-8x the revenue, which would be huge for Is It Keto, but I'll wait to see what happens.

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Published my [July retrospective](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2020/08/).
- Added my notes for [_The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_](https://mtlynch.io/book-reports/7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/).
- Updated my stat aggregator to pull in [TinyPilot stats and overall stats](https://github.com/mtlynch/make-mtlynch-stats/commit/102be1fe25ebe10535e1aafea95acd2c3bfdf885).
  - I had to add support for thousands separators for dollar amounts, which is a nice milestone (it was previously so rare for me to have revenue figures >$1k that I never noticed this bug).

## [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com)

- Worked with UserKit to chase down a UserKit dummy-mode bug.

## [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org)

_In an effort to help Gridsome improve dev velocity, I've been volunteering a few hours a week to help [manage their documentation](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome.org)._

- Reviewed two minor PRs.

## Beekeeping

- Bottled the remaining honey and cleaned up all the honey extracting equipment.

## Misc

- Attended the Indie Hackers Western Mass virtual meetup
- [Played with Cory Zue's new code review analytics tool](https://twitter.com/deliberatecoder/status/1290624096905158657) and gave him feedback about my first impressions.
  - He's looking for volunteers if you're into code metrics.
