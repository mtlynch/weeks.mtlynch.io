## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Zero sales this week, despite me trying lots of stuff
- Put a [second meal plan](https://isitketo.org/meal-plans/#mushroom) up for sale as well as a bundle pack for both plans: no sales
- Dropped price from $15 per plan to $5 per plan: no sales
- Bumped prices to $10 per plan, but offered a 30% discount if users answer a survey about what they want out of the meal plans: zero responses
- Published a [blog post](https://isitketo.org/blog/announcing-meal-plans/) announcing the keto meal plans
- Made [some posts on keto subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/user/isitketo) to try to attract customers or feedback about the meal plans.
- Had my first in-person 1:1 with my writer
- Reviewed first draft of a new article
- Cleaned up some of the site's CSS

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Continued working on my post about eliminating distractions
- Reached out to two more freelance writing podcasts to see if they'd talk to me about my [guide to hiring writers](https://mtlynch.io/hiring-content-writers/).
- Followed up with a podcast I contacted last week
  - Got a polite "no"

## Home Video Digitization

Last year, I digitized about 40 hours of my family’s old home videos and put them on a private media server for my family. I’m in the process of cleaning up my tools so I can publish a guide about this.

- Got my private Docker image to work with the latest mainline MediaGoblin code
- Updated my public Docker image to work with the lastest mainline MediaGoblin code + Python 3 ([#31](https://github.com/mtlynch/mediagoblin-docker/pull/31))

## [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com)

- Added the ability for users to delete published entries ([#319](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/pull/319))
  - If you want to do this, erase the content of the entry and hit "Publish"

## Misc

- Did a phone interview with a reporter interested in tech jobs that turn unpleasant
- Made an appointment with a local accountant to talk about joining as a client

## [Dusty VCR](https://dustyvcr.com)

- Published episode #12: ["Mrs. Doubtfire (w/ Tricia D'Onofrio)"](https://dustyvcr.com/12-mrs-doubtfire/)
- Realized that Anchor is now [the most widely-used podcast hosts](https://www.listennotes.com/podcast-stats/)
  - I think I evaluated them when I first launched the podcast, but was skeptical of the "free hosting" model, but now I may switch because I'm currently paying $15/mo on Libsyn.
- Booked guests for episode #14
- Ordered audio/recording equipment so that we can record two guests at once
