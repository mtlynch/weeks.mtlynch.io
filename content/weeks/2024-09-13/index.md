## [Refactoring English](https://refactoringenglish.com)

- Changed the self-ad on mtlynch.io to be for this book
- Created a Nix flake for the landing page
- Ported the mailing list to Buttondown

## NixOS config

  - This was interesting because it required a custom derivation based on the AppImage, as there was no available Nix package
- Added burp suite

## [PicoShare](https://pico.rocks)

_PicoShare is a minimalist web-based file sharing tool I’m working on. I’m often frustrated that I can’t just send someone a link directly to a file because every file-sharing service tries to re-encode images/video or wrap their own viewer around other files, so I’m making a simple self-hostable tool that lets you upload files and share them with other people._
