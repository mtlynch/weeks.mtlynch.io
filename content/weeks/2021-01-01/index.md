## 2020 Year in Review

_Inspired by [@michaelcampbell](https://whatgotdone.com/michaelcampbell/2021-01-01). See below for weekly update._

  - Attended lots of shows to interview comedians and attendees
  - Made my first affiliate deal with a comedy performance (which earned $0)

### February

_Okay, now back to your regularly scheduled weekly update._

## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com)

- Released the first beta version of [TinyPilot Pro](https://tinypilotkvm.com/product/tinypilot-pro)
- Added a digital product checkout flow to the online store
  - Sold seven licenses in the first 24 hours
- Polished TinyPilot Pro's new UI interfaces
  - Login screen: [before](C03k.webp) vs. [after](P6i5.webp)
  - Settings screen: [before](aunA.webp) vs. [after](c3Gc.webp)
- Allow user to turn off password authentication after enabling it
- Updated install instructions for all TinyPilot products
  - I had the dumb idea to change a label on the TinyPilot power connector case, then changed it back, not thinking about how much work I was creating for myself in taking all new photos and updating instructions for customers.
- Signed up for [Notifier for Reddit](https://notifierforreddit.com/)
  - I keep missing discussions of TinyPilot on reddit, so this might be a good solution
  - It sent me a notification email within 1 min of my test email
  - I also tried [F5Bot](https://f5bot.com/) (free), which worked in 5 mins
  - I'll probably end up with F5Bot because Notifier doesn't offer much over the free solution for my use case, and it covers more platforms
- Tested PoE with TinyPilot
  - Doesn't work
  - Annoyingly, the [Pi PoE HAT and the HDMI to CSI bridge](https://github.com/pikvm/pikvm/issues/6#issuecomment-703448910) clash with each other. There's a workaround, but it disables the fan on the PoE hat, which is also a problem.
- Added support for listing discounts on the website.
- Created [a job posting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DPvwbEqCJjJ2f6GklQ0lQnVvfgFNsAAahgzLRjox1-g/edit?usp=sharing) for a part-time dev position
  - If you've read to this point in my What Got Done, and you want this job, please reach out, as you'll likely have a huge advantage as someone who's already interested in this work.
  - Published the job application on [borderline.biz](http://borderline.biz/careers) after seeing it [advertised on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25603197)
- Added support for downloading the device's CA certificate
  - Allows the user to trust a self-signed application certificate
  - As far as I can tell, this is the only way to make a browser trust the certificate of an internal server's certificate because normal certificate providers can't sign an internal device's TLS certificate.
- Added protections to ensure an unauthorized user can't access the TinyPilot video stream without being logged in
- Added support for signing TLS certificate when the hostname is not `tinypilot`

## [_Hit the Front Page of Hacker News_](https://gum.co/htfphn/hacker)

- Recorded and published a new section of the course to pre-order customers
- Overhauled my ffmpeg postprocessing script
  - Now it runs on my beefy VM server instead of my dev box
  - It only uses 20% of the server's CPU power because it encodes one video at a time. I'm resisting the urge to overengineer it into really fast parallel processing.
- Finished sending personalized thank you letters to everyone who provided feedback on test runs of the course
- Found a blogger interested in participating in one of the "deep dives" in the course bonus material

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Published book report for [_How to Be an Antiracist_](https://mtlynch.io/book-reports/antiracist/)
- [Removed all affiliate links](https://twitter.com/deliberatecoder/status/1342847048811499523) from the blog
  - I'm tired of Google search results cluttered with affiliate spam, and I don't want my blog to be mixed up in it.
- Started my December retrospective

## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Updated dead Amazon affiliate links in preparation for the New Year's rush of traffic
  - (Despite my self-righteous anti-affiliate link stance in the previous section)

## [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com)

- Thought about how I want to add more features to What Got Done but don't have the bandwidth.
