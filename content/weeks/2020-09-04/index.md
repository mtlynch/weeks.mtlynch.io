## [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org)

_In an effort to help Gridsome improve dev velocity, I've been volunteering a few hours a week to help [manage their documentation](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome.org)._

- Reviewed two PRs
  - [Update Deploy to Vercel Guide](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome.org/pull/517)
  - [Added "Dynamic Image Paths in Vue Templates"](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome.org/pull/519)

## Misc

- Fixed a leak in my freezer that had been driving me nuts for months
  - Apparently there's a regular defrost cycle that drains melted ice through a tube that empties into a basin under the fridge. But at some point, the tube had frozen over, so no ice could go down, so it was dripping through the roof of my fridge.
  - I had to unplug my fridge, pull the rear wall off the freezer, then keep pouring boiling water on the ice until it all melted away and cleared the path down the tube.
  - [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6TNv1FC82w) was a pretty good guide.
- Watched some sessions from SaaStr
- Caught up on bookkeeping
- Contributed an About page to the [gridsome-starter-shopify repo](https://github.com/thetre97/gridsome-starter-shopify/pull/12) (what I'm using for TinyPilot's website)
