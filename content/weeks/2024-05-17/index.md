## [zenith](https://github.com/mtlynch/zenith)

_zenith is an experimental implementation of the Ethereum virtual machine in pure Zig. I probably won't implement the whole thing, but it's a fun way to play around with Zig on a project where Zig does seem to actually be the right tool._

- Upgraded to [Zig 0.12.0](https://github.com/mtlynch/zenith/pull/90)

## Exploding Servers

- Experimented with [htmx](https://htmx.org)
  - It's interesting!
  - For a long time, I avoided it because I thought it was incompatible with CSP, but when I tried it today, it seems to be mostly compatible with CSP.
    - I'm not sure if that's a change or something I just didn't realize was true before.
  - It could solve a problem I have where I feel like I have to implement elements once in HTML at page render time and then another time in JavaScript when the page changes in response to user actions.
  - Exploding Servers is a good project to experiment with htmx because it's still very early.

## Home maintenance

- Got rid of old pegboard in basement
- Got quote for new mini split

## Misc

- Did monthly bookkeeping
- Moved my TrueNAS server to a nice Sliger case
  - Now it's [rack mounted](3KhS.webp), whereas before it was sitting on a box at the bottom of my rack, preventing the rack from being wheeled
- Split a bunch of logs
  - I forgot how fun it is!
  - I split a bunch of logs from a felled tree years ago, but then I got to logs that were too big to split with a regular ax
  - I bought a sledgehammer and wedge, and now I can split way more of the large logs.
