## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com)

- Tried to install TinyPilot on alternative single-board computers: [no luck](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/issues/79#issuecomment-663736165)
  - But, in the process I made the Ansible role a bit more robust: [#39](https://github.com/mtlynch/ansible-role-tinypilot/pull/39), [#40](https://github.com/mtlynch/ansible-role-tinypilot/pull/40), [#41](https://github.com/mtlynch/ansible-role-tinypilot/pull/41), [#42](https://github.com/mtlynch/ansible-role-tinypilot/pull/42).
- Worked on improvements to inventory system.
- Explored advertising options.
- Updated the install script to [allow more configurability](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/pull/145).
- Added instructions for [setting up a read-only filesystem](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/pull/147).
- Tried to add Google Tag Manager - no luck.
- Updated assembly instructions.
- Continued experimenting with TinyPilot stickers.
- Answered support emails.

## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Continued discussions with AdThrive about moving from AdSense to AdThrive.

## [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

- Experimenting with a switch from RapidAPI (constant headaches) to servernope (brand new).

## Beekeeping

- Cleaned my bee suit

## Misc

- Tested an alternative to Grammarly: [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com/)
  - So far, pretty buggy/unintuitive, but maybe there's a learning curve to it.
