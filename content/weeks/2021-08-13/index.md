## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com)

### Management

- Continued working with EU distributor on spinning up sales from Germany
- Worked on setting up a test machine so that local staff can QA TinyPilot releases
- Had 1:1 with local staff member
- Scheduled 1:1s with two developers
- Realized I have to fix something stupid in my corporate registration to handle sales tax properly.
  - I've been accidentally overpaying sales tax on my purchases for the past year, but now MA thinks I owe them sales tax on my sales, so that's going to be a fun thing to straighten out.

### Software development

- Code reviewed a new GCP cloud function for checking whether a user has a TinyPilot Pro license
  - It checks against the store data in Shopify.
- Watched as TinyPilot's developers code reviewed for each other and realized I should have been doing this long ago.
- Gave feedback on UX for a new feature.

### Customer support

- Added [self-serve downloads](https://twitter.com/deliberatecoder/status/1426297257532481539) for the latest TinyPilot Pro image
  - The issue was that I can't just publish the image for everyone since it's reserved for customers, but we didn't have a good way for customers to prove they were customers in an automated way.
  - The process in the past has always been for users to just email me, but I finally invested dev resources into automating it so that I'm no longer in the critical path.
- Clarified product instructions for finding the TinyPilot web interface

### Product research

- Met with EE vendor about next-gen Voyager development

### Sales

- Reached out to two YouTube creators about a potential partnership
  - One declined, the other hasn't responded, which seems like a bad sign.
  - I may have exhausted YouTube as a marketing channel.
- Reviewed a redesign to the landing page that makes the feature brags more compact
  - [Before vs. After](/2020-08-14/jjJk.webp)
- Met with customer about potential enterprise feature
- Continued firming up details for podcast appearance

### Misc

- Reached out to another Pi company about exchanging ideas

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Started writing notes for _How to Stop Worrying and Start Living_ by Dale Carnegie
- Started writing notes for _Badass: Making Users Awesome_ by Kathy Sierra

## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Got approved by Mediavine!
  - They're a premium ad partner who supposedly pays several multiples more than AdSense, my current ad partner.
- I withdrew from the Mediavine process after I read their partner agreement.
- The Mediavine contract is extremely one-sided and hostile to publishers. Some highlights:
  - I'm required to run Mediavine ads for at least three months.
  - After the three months, I need to give Mediavine 30 days' notice before I stop running their ads.
  - Mediavine, of course, is allowed to alter or terminate the agreement at any time.
  - If Mediavine alters the agreement, they must give me notice, but my only options are to terminate the contract (within 24 hours of the change) or accept the new changes.
  - I'm not allowed to speak to other ad partners about potential partnerships while my Mediavine contract is in effect.
  - Mediavine might give me other contracts to sign, and my contract requires me to sign those other contracts, even though I currently can't read them.
  - After I sign the contract, Mediavine will send me instructions for integrating their ads into my site, and I have to obey them, even though I currently can't read those instructions.

## [WanderJest](https://wanderjest.com)

- Add more rigorous parsing for user bios
- Add more rigorous parsing for city and state fields for performance venues
- Continue working on integrating cropper.js so that users can crop photos how they want
- Refactored logic around image uploads

## [LogPaste](https://logpaste.com)

- [Upgraded to litestream 0.3.5](https://github.com/mtlynch/logpaste/pull/115) to take advantage of its new `-exec` flag.
  - The `-exec` flag makes sure that if Litestream stops replicating my data, my app dies loudly instead of quietly writing data that will be lost on server redeploy.

## [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

- Spun up a free Zestful server for participants in the [World Data Pipeline Competition](https://datapipelinewc.com/)

## Home maintenance

- Cleaned out my dryer duct
  - Apparently, it's a common cause of house fires, and you're supposed to clean it out every year.
  - I had never cleaned it in the 3 years I've lived in this house...
  - It ended up being easier than I expected. It only took about 30 minutes. It helped that I already had a duct cleaning brush for cleaning exhaust from my pellet stove.

  - [After](8F2q.webp)
- Talked to handyman about replacing siding on my house

## Misc

- Went through a bunch of my suits and set aside half for donation
  - I don't know how I've ended up with 6 suits, as someone who hasn't needed a suit for work in 7 years
- Tweeted [my highlights](https://twitter.com/deliberatecoder/status/1424894185547644929) from Ch Daniel's interview with Jason Cohen
