## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com)

- Cut a new release ([1.1.3](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/releases/tag/1.1.3)).
- Experimented with a new video capture device.
- Reviewed a user-contributed PR to add [support for mouse wheel scrolling](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/pull/307).
- Continued working with 3D printer on the design for a new TinyPilot case and power connector.
- Conducted a customer interview.
- Updated instructions to include directions for users who are connecting through a VGA to HDMI adaptor.
  - As an experiment, I tried adding a VGA-to-HDMI adaptor as an add-on you could buy with TinyPilot kits.
  - It seems like it's working, as 3 of 14 kits sold last week included the VGA-to-HDMI add-on.
- Reviewed a contractor's PR to cache Shopify data under source control rather than query the remote API every time we build the TinyPilot website.
- Did some emergency inventory juggling because two of my restocking orders for HDMI dongles got delayed in shipping.
  - Managed to avoid going into backlog, but I did miss shipment SLO for one customer, but I emailed them and upgraded them to priority shipping to make up for it.
  - Reassessed my inventory reserve numbers to prevent it in the future.
- Checked in with customers who recently received their kits.

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Finished a draft of my new code review article and passed it to my editor for review.

## Hacker News video course

- Decided to make an info product!
- I'm going to start with a video course about how to write blog posts that resonate with Hacker News.
  - If that goes well, I'm going to write a guide to help developers improve their writing.
- Wrote an illustration spec for the cover and hired an illustrator.
- Put together an outline.
- Watched [Everyone Can Build a Twitter Audience](https://gumroad.com/l/twitter-audience) for inspiration of what a simple video course looks like that [earned $150k](https://twitter.com/deliberatecoder/status/1320423545449664514).

## Zestful

- Had a call with a customer interested in an enterprise package.

## Beekeeping

- Refilled my bees' sugar syrup feeders.

## Misc

- Purchased a new phone after [@dtq](https://whatgotdone.com/dtq) informed me that my phone reaches EOL at the end of this month.
  - Bummer because I was perfectly happy with my Pixel 2.
  - I went with the Pixel 4a because it supports Fi, has a headphone jack, and seems positively reviewed.
  - I was surprised that phones EOL so quickly. It's crazy that that's the norm. It'd be like if Microsoft suddenly decided they didn't like my CPU anymore and just stopped allowing me to receive Windows updates.
  - Also considered:
    - [Pinephone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/) - neat, but it seems immature, so I'd be afraid to rely on it.
    - [Librem 5](https://shop.puri.sm/shop/librem-5-usa/) - kind of same issue, but it's not out yet, and $2k is pretty steep.
    - [OnePlus 7T](https://www.oneplus.com/7t): I've heard good things, but it seems like they don't explicitly guarantee a date for software updates, and they've historically stopped updating after 2 years or less.
    - Everything else - didn't want to deal with vendor bloatware
