## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Added 9 new food articles.
- Fixed AdSense ads code so that ads reload when users change pages.
- Fixed Firebase hosting configuration so that it stopped forwarding users to pages with a trailing slash.
  - I realized this after Google Search Console showed [a huge jump in unindexed pages](/2021-09-24/BpLn.webp).
- Fixed a browse view that was showing foods in reverse alphabetical order.

## [Portfolio Rebalancer](https://assetrebalancer.com)

- Reached out to user who signed up but didn't subscribe

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Published my [April Retrospective](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2020/05/)
- Published my notes for [_Nonviolent Communication_](https://mtlynch.io/book-reports/nonviolent-communication/)
- Continued working on a tutorial for bulk publishing videos to MediaGoblin
- [Updated my Hugo image shortcode](https://github.com/mtlynch/mtlynch.io/pull/599) to automatically set maxWidth based on the image's actual pixel size.

## [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com)

- Continued working on integrating a WYSIWYG editor for writing weekly updates.
  - It seems like testing it is going to be a challenge because the E2E framework doesn't seem to get along with the rich text editor.

## Beekeeping

- My hive swarmed!
  - This was a bit of an adventure chasing down the swarm and getting it into a new hive box. Luckily my beekeeping neighbor guided me through it, and the family who owned the house where the swarm landed was incredibly friendly and accommodating in letting us recover it.

## Misc

- [Submitted a PR](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome/pull/1150) to Gridsome to help diagnose a JavaScript crash I keep seeing on Is It Keto
- Balanced my books
