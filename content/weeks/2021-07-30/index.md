## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com)

### Management

- Made more progress on contract with EU distributor
- Send first batch of materials to EU distributor
- Gave local employees dedicated TinyPilot email accounts
- Filed an annual report for my LLC
- Updated our stocktake workflow to happen weekly
- Enabled tax-exempt status on my Amazon account
  - In my state, I'm exempt from taxes on raw materials because I manufacture them into taxable products that I resell, but not all vendors support this status.
  - I didn't realize that Amazon supported this all along, and it takes 10 mins to turn it on.
  - I've probably paid $2k in needless taxes, but at least I'm stopping it now

### Software development

- Verified that teammates can build a TinyPilot production image
- Added iptables rules to my build servers to limit access

### Product research

- Started the ball rolling again on the rack mount design

- Add more rigorous parsing of user-submitted URLs.
- Refactored the JSON decoding logic.

## [_Refactoring English_](https://refactoringenglish.com)

- Mostly migrated the site to Hugo
  - It was just a plain HTML page, but I want to make it easier for me to publish chapter excerpts on the site

- Recorded a new episode (_Miss Congeniality_)
- Hired an editor
