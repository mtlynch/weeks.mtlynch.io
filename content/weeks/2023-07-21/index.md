### Management

- Two 1:1s with teammates

### Software development

- Led TinyPilot dev team meeting
- Reviewed [a fix to the Cython 3.0 / pyyaml break](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/pull/1508)

### Customer support

- Reviewed support article about bringing your own TLS keys
- Revised [installation instructions for TinyPilot Community](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/pull/1502)
- Continued fighting with Amazon on a $1k refund
  - Warehouse sent the customer USB-C units instead of PoE units
  - Customer asked us to replace it with the correct PoE units
  - Amazon auto-refunded the customer because they saw them ship a return back to our office...
  - I created a support case, and they rejected it because, "You listed the item against a detail page that it did not exactly match. When you list an offer, it must exactly match the brand, manufacturer, UPC, model number, edition, quantity, packaging, and color of the product on the detail page."
    - I've appealed because it's crazy that the customer would get to keep $1k worth of merchandise for free because we sent the wrong item the first time.

## [PicoShare](https://pico.rocks)

_PicoShare is a minimalist web-based file sharing tool I’m working on. I’m often frustrated that I can’t just send someone a link directly to a file because every file-sharing service tries to re-encode images/video or wrap their own viewer around other files, so I’m making a simple self-hostable tool that lets you upload files and share them with other people._

- Reviewed a contribution that [made Litestream retention configurable](https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare/pull/447)
- Cut the [1.3.6 release](https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare/releases/tag/1.3.6)

## [Talk to Stan](https://talktostan.com)

_Talk to Stan is a tool I'm working on that will respond to templated emails I get from spammy marketers and recruiters with a sequence of templated responses to ask the spammers an endless series of dumb questions._
