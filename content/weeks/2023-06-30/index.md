### Management

- 1:1 with teammate.
- Met with EU distributor.
- Discussed new pricing with distributor after we switch to a contract manufacturer.
  - We're shifting work from the distributor to the contract manufacturer, so we have to figure out how it impacts prices.
- Got up to date with invoices for EU distributor.
- Redefined the release testing process to delegate some tasks that were previously Michael-only
- Ordered raw materials

### Software development

- Published [TinyPilot Pro 2.6.0](https://tinypilotkvm.com/pro/changes#260)
  - Wrote [release announcement](https://tinypilotkvm.com/blog/whats-new-in-2023-06)
  - Completed 2.6.0 release testing
- Defined a work item for adding PWM fan control to TinyPilot
- Advised on [nginx dependency refactoring work](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/pull/1469)
- Reviewed a PR to [improve an error message on TinyPilot](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/pull/1468)

### Customer support

- Revised TinyPilot Pro license check page
  - Customers were emailing us asking for an image download for purchases 2+ years ago not realizing that their licenses had expired.
  - The problem was that the download page only explained that licenses expire after a year after the user entered information for an expired license, but if it was so old that they no longer had their order information, they emailed us.
  - I revised the content to clarify license duration.
