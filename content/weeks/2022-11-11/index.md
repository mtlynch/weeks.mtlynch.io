### Management

- Coordinated a fix for a manufacturing issue
- Investigated ways to mitigate our approaching shortage of device cases
  - We're selling devices faster than our 3D printing vendor can manufacture cases
  - Bought a $5k 3D printer
    - It no longer made sense for our 3D printing vendor to buy new printers for us since we're switching away from 3D printing in a few months, so the best option was to buy our own printer, which our vendor agreed to own and operate, and then we'll sell it used when we're done.
  - Continued getting quotes from other 3D printing vendors who can supplement case production
- Held three 1:1s
- Met with a designer about potential work with TinyPilot
- Continued speaking to 3PL vendors about migrating fulfillment
- Started to try Pilot as a contractor payment platform
  - I haven't liked Deel or Remote, so I'm hoping Pilot is a better fit
- Debugged an issue with balena Etcher on our office computer
  - It turned out the software was out of date. I updated it and then it introduced a new bug. Fixed the new bug.
- Finally cleaned off a bunch of case prototype stuff that's been covering my desk

### Software development

- Reviewed [video streaming mode indicator](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/pull/1181)
- Created bugs to track work we need to do to support streaming audio
- Experimented with [vessel for Fly.io](https://github.com/Vessel-App/vessel-cli)
  - The idea is that if you have a project you want to build/serve on an ephemeral VM, vessel will spin up a Fly VM for you and sync files from your local directory to the remote VM
    - Sort of like Github Codespaces?
  - It sounds cool, but I'm running into [a lot of bugs](https://github.com/Vessel-App/vessel-cli/issues/created_by/mtlynch) trying to take it for a spin
  - Submitted [a fix for the proxy launcher](https://github.com/Vessel-App/vessel-cli/pull/26)
  - Submitted a [fix for the installer](https://github.com/Vessel-App/vessel-installer/pull/1)
