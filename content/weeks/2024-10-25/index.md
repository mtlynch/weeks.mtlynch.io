## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Published [Using Nix to Fuzz Test a PDF Parser](https://mtlynch.io/nix-fuzz-testing-1/)
  - I maybe overinvested in this. It didn't get traction anywhere but took a long time to write.
  - Still, I learned a lot by writing it, so it was helpful in that way.
- Updated ["Running NixOS on Proxmox"](https://mtlynch.io/notes/nixos-proxmox/) so that it works with the latest version of NixOS and Proxmox
- Wrote ["Massachusetts Residents Can Sue Online Merchants for Spam"](https://mtlynch.io/notes/ma-residents-can-sue-over-email/)
- Continued working on "Lessons from My First Exit" that I backburnered a few months ago

## [openc2e](https://openc2e.github.io/)

_openc2e is an open-source reimplementation of the 90s/2000s computer game series Creatures. It started around 20 years ago, and it's still not nearly done, but it's exciting that there's progress._

- Started configuring a NixOS server to be my "always on" services server
