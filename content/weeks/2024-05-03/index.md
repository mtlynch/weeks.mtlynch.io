## [zenith](https://github.com/mtlynch/zenith)

_zenith is an experimental implementation of the Ethereum virtual machine in pure Zig. I probably won't implement the whole thing, but it's a fun way to play around with Zig on a project where Zig does seem to actually be the right tool._

- Renamed the project from `eth-zvm` to `zenith` (rolls off the tongue a bit better)

## [PicoShare](https://pico.rocks)

_PicoShare is a minimalist web-based file sharing tool I’m working on. I’m often frustrated that I can’t just send someone a link directly to a file because every file-sharing service tries to re-encode images/video or wrap their own viewer around other files, so I’m making a simple self-hostable tool that lets you upload files and share them with other people._

- Updated [`go.mod` to use go 1.21](https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare/pull/568)
- Started experimenting [with a new SQLite driver that supports the streaming blob API for SQLite](https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare/pull/567)

## Exploding Servers

_Exploding Servers is a pet project, maybe business that lets people spawn servers that automatically get killed after a set expiration time. Maybe it's a business. Who knows!_

- Display the server's state in the list of servers (starting, stopping, etc.)
- Add UI controls to allow the user to pick their OS
- Delete the "user" dropdown menu from the UI
- Make AMD64 the default architecture

## Misc

- Bought a new [server chassis for my homelab NAS server](https://www.sliger.com/products/rackmount/storage/cx3701/)
