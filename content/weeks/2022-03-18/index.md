## [PicoShare](https://pico.rocks)

_PicoShare is a minimalist web-based file sharing tool I’m working on. I’m often frustrated that I can’t just send someone a link directly to a file because every file-sharing service tries to re-encode images/video or wrap their own viewer around other files, so I’m making a simple self-hostable tool that lets you upload files and share them with other people._

- Added support for [pasting data from the clipboard](https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare/pull/59)
- [Refactored upload logic](https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare/pull/61)
