## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com)

### Management

- Held first meeting with contract manufacturer and hardware consultants

  - <https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/pull/1464>
  - <https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/pull/1465>
- Migrated Google Analytics to GA4
  - I think I did it?
  - They've been making a big deal and sending me scary emails for months, and when I finally sat down to do it, it seems like there's nothing to do except check a bunch of boxes saying I've migrated.

### Sales

- Checked in on new reviewer to verify they received everything

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Published ["My First Impressions of Nix"](https://mtlynch.io/notes/nix-first-impressions/)
  - I was surprised this was popular. I put it in my "notes" section as it was meant to be quick notes I capture as I learn Nix.
- Worked on a tutorial for installing NixOS on the Raspberry Pi 4
  - All the tutorials I've found were either incomplete or didn't work for me.

## [WhatGotDone](https://whatgotdone.com)

- Switched [from Google Analytics to Plausible](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/pull/869)
  - I dropped view counts in the process, which hadn't been working anyway
  - With the whole GA4 push,

## Misc

- Discovered [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)
  - It's a neat browser-based optimization game.

  - CyberPower CP1500PFCRM2U is _way_ better than the Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD
  - The Tripp Lite was 2x louder than anything else on my rack, and the CyberPower is totally silent and has better LCD output
- Did monthly bookkeeping for non-TinyPilot businesses
