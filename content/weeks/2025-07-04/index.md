## [PicoShare](https://pico.rocks)

_PicoShare is a minimalist web-based file sharing tool I’m working on. I’m often frustrated that I can’t just send someone a link directly to a file because every file-sharing service tries to re-encode images/video or wrap their own viewer around other files, so I’m making a simple self-hostable tool that lets you upload files and share them with other people._

  - Moving closer to [fully parsing timestamps](https://codeberg.org/mtlynch/gleam-chat-log-parser/pulls/16)
- Tried to get Niri working on my main NixOS workstation

  - It worked for a second, and then it froze, and when I rebooted, I couldn't enable the PaperWM extension anymore despite no errors
