## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

_I'm going to start paying a bit more attention to Is It Keto given that it's my only project that grows and earns revenue._

- [Analyzed my site stats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1srsCDhUn8JOB1Uprz7mykpxAiErL7MpOGFEK-dsE1TQ/edit?usp=sharing) to try and figure out why some of my pages rank highly on Google while others barely rank
- [Posted analysis to /r/juststart](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/cmslmx/why_google_likes_some_of_my_articles_and_hates/?st=jz4mfzrw&sh=16799764) for feedback
  - Takeaways
    - The best bang for my buck way to increase search rankings is to get backlinks from keto-adjacent blogs (e.g., fitness, parenting, nutrition)
      - I previously was trying to get links from other keto sites, who likely didn't want to link to a competitor.
    - I should include more details in my `title` and `meta` tags to better match my target search queries
    - Pinterest has the potential to bring in as much traffic as Google
    - People [think I'm dumb](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/cmslmx/why_google_likes_some_of_my_articles_and_hates/ew5e320/) for posting financial details of my site on Reddit
    - Reddit I think has the highest ratio of condescension to useful information of any forum I post on
- Changed my `title` tag format
  - **Before**: "Metamucil - Is It Keto"
  - **After**: "Is Metamucil Keto? - Is It Keto"
  - Most of the queries I rank for are like "metamucil keto" or "is metamucil keto", so I'm hoping that by structuring the titles to more closely mirror the search terms, I'll rank higher.
- [Joined Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/isitketo/) and tried to figure out Pinterest
  - Currently at 3 pins and 8 followers, some of whom appear to be actual humans
  - Temporarily had my account banned for following too many accounts (after like 150 follows, which IIRC was tolerated on Twitter)
- Joined Quora and [posted some answers](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-Lynch-455) with links back to Is It Keto
  - Wrote a new article about [Maple syrup](https://isitketo.org/maple-syrup) to answer a user's question
  - Doesn't seem to have any effect yet
- Scouted blogs for opportunities to do a guest post
  - Messaged one, got no response
- Updated the sitemap so that food URLs have a `<lastmod>` field, which will hopefully encourage Google to re-index it soon after edits
