## [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com)

- [Open-sourced](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone) What Got Done!
  - Sort of a "quiet" publication of the source for now
    - I'm still trying to figure out if there are ways of making the code more accessible.
    - Currently, people have to jump through nontrivial hoops in order to run the app locally (creating a UserKit app, creating a dedicated GCP project).
- Added a "Contribute" link to the navbar ([#285](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/pull/285))
- Fixed another bug in my implementation of CSRF mitigation ([#271](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/pull/271))
  - (hopefully for the last time)
- Added an architecture diagram to the README ([#284](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/pull/284)).
- Filled out missing sections of the README ([#283](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/pull/283), [#273](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/pull/273))
- Added the Apache2 license ([#282](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/pull/282))
- Added a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file ([#281](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/pull/281))
- Minor refactoring ([#275](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/pull/275), [#274](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/pull/274))

## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Reached out to a meal plan author for a possible partnership deal
- Continued processing applications for freelance writers from job postings I made at local colleges:
  - 4 new applications
  - Hired a new writer on a trial basis
  - Ended an earlier trial (no-hire)
- Reviewed a first draft from one of my trial hires

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Continued working on my guide to hiring freelance writers

## [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

- Had a meeting with another company who's interested in partnering with Zestful to publish an API that parses ingredients from photos of printed recipes
  - Would you use this service? If so, [email me](https://mtlynch.io/about/)!
- Checked in with an active customer
- Added support for `deciliter`, `decilitre`, and `dl` as units of measure (after my first time seeing them in the wild)

## [Dusty VCR](https://dustyvcr.com)

- Recorded episode #11 and started editing it
- Nailed down schedule for show #12

## Beekeeping

- Did a hive inspection
  - Got my first sting to the face (through my veil)
    - My face swelled up comically for a few days, but I was otherwise fine

## Misc

- Reached out to computer science and entrepreneurship student groups at Smith College, UMass Amherst, and Mt. Holyoke College inviting them to the next [Indie Hackers meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nerdsummit/events/263870544/)
- Installed the squat rack and foam flooring in my home gym and did my first two workouts at home (way better than driving 40 mins round trip to the gym)
- Shopped around for a new house cleaner
- Consolidated all of my domains to Google Domains (goodbye GoDaddy)

## Goals for next week

- Continue working on affiliate partnerships for Is It Keto
- Commission artwork for my next mtlynch.io post
