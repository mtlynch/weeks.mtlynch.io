## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com)

### Management

- 1:1 with local staff member and support engineer
- Coordinated with manufacturer and local staff to manage low supply

### Software development

- Added integration tests for Gatekeeper
- Added a `LaterThan` function for TinyPilot versions in Gatekeeper
- Added support in Gatekeeper for parsing pre-release install bundles
- Continued working on REST APIs for getting latest version available and downloading install packages
- Updated [paths to license files](https://github.com/tiny-pilot/tinypilot/pull/1054) for Ansible dependencies (for our About page)

### Customer support

- Handled a complicated return
- Resumed offering USPS as a shipping option to Australia
  - USPS hasn't been able to reliably ship to Australia since mid-2021
- Revised our customer support guidance on responding to customers who ask for discounts
  - Our previous policy was that if someone asked for a discount, we assume they're going to be a problem customer and we gently steer them away from buying
  - We got an email from someone who said they bought one device and loved it so much they want more, so could we offer a discount?
  - We decided to adjust out policy for existing customers, so we offered a discount, and he ended up purchasing three more
