## [fusion](https://github.com/0x2E/fusion)

_fusion is an open-source RSS reader I found when looking for an RSS aggregator to host on my NixOS system. I like that it's written in Go and uses SQLite as a backend, so it's pretty easy to self-host. The maintainer is very responsive to PRs as well._

- Refactored [RSS item parsing](https://github.com/0x2E/fusion/pull/84)
