- Worked on a blog post about using Nix to do fuzz testing

## [PicoShare](https://pico.rocks)

_PicoShare is a minimalist web-based file sharing tool I’m working on. I’m often frustrated that I can’t just send someone a link directly to a file because every file-sharing service tries to re-encode images/video or wrap their own viewer around other files, so I’m making a simple self-hostable tool that lets you upload files and share them with other people._

- Experimented more with the [ncruces SQLite driver](https://github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3/issues/148#issuecomment-2350982480)

## Misc

- Found a bug in xpdf 4.05 [through fuzzing](https://gitlab.com/mtlynch/fuzz-xpdf), but it turned out that someone else found the same bug a few weeks ago.
- Cleaned dishwasher
