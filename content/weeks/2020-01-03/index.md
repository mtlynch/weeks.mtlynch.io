## [WanderJest](http://wanderjest.com)

- Officially debuted the site to a small comedy Facebook group in Western Massachusetts.
- So far, this is the most engaged an audience has been for any new project I've launched.
  - Currently, 100% of people I've reached out to want to talk about the site and are interested in collaborating in some way.
- Interviewed three comedians / comedy show hosts to talk about what they want from the site.
- Interviewed a comedy booker to ask about how he currently promotes his shows.
- Got verbal agreement with a local comedy teacher to run ads on WanderJest
  - They'll pay a percentage commission for each student who signs up through the site.
- Talked to a local comedian / graphic designer about designing a logo for the site.
- Reached out to an additional booker who agreed to a meeting next week.
- Reached out to a comedy theater who agreed to a call next week.

- Created my own [html-proofer Docker image](https://github.com/mtlynch/html-proofer-docker) because no existing solution had explicit version tags.
- Responded to a few user emails that came in after my old post popped up on Hacker News again.

## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Published a new article on [salad dressing](https://isitketo.org/salad-dressing)
- Added some crosslinks between articles that were missing
- Fixed some dead links to related Amazon products

## [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

- Responded to a user question about using the open source ingredient parser
  - [Updated the documentation](https://github.com/mtlynch/ingredient-phrase-tagger/pull/58) so that the instructions work cross-platform (they previously assumed a bash shell on the host system).

## Misc
