## [WanderJest](http://wanderjest.com)

- MVP is complete!
  - I'm holding off on "officially" releasing it because the comedy scene is quiet over the holidays, but it's in a state that I'm comfortable showing it to people in my target audience after the new year even if I make no further changes.
- Created "detail" pages for shows and comedians, so now you can click a particular show or comedian and get more information
  - [Example show](http://wanderjest.com/show/luthiers-2020-01-07)
  - [Example comedian](http://wanderjest.com/comedian/matt.woodland)
- Added server-side rendering for comedians and show pages so that social sharing works
  - [Sharing a show on Facebook](TrMUYEK.webp)
- Made some fake bios for the comedians
  - For comedians that don't have public bios, I created jokey bios that appear randomly every time you refresh a [comedian's profile page](http://wanderjest.com/comedian/matt.woodland).
- Changed recurring weekly/monthly shows to generate programmatically (I was previously just copying them by hand)
- Added lots more shows to the schedule.
- Reached out to two local businesses asking about sponsorship (no response)

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Continued the process of migrating mtlynch.io from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
  - Hugo is more pleasant to work with in a lot of ways: speed, simplicity, design. Documentation is tough to follow, though.
- I'm about 75-80% done.
- I wrote ugly, ugly [Python scripts](https://github.com/mtlynch/migrate-mtlynch-to-hugo) to automatically translate my customizations from Jekyll to Hugo because it's way too hard to do by hand.
- Someone resubmitted my [quitting Google post](https://mtlynch.io/why-i-quit-google/) to Hacker News and it [briefly reached #1](http://hnrankings.info/21882791/).
  - I didn't even realize what happened, except that I was suddenly getting lots of new Twitter followers and Disqus comments on the post, and then finally someone mentioned Hacker News. By then, I'd already disappeared from the front page.
  - Fun to see it get some renewed attention!

## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Gave notes on a new article draft.
- Brought meal plans [back to the navbar and homepage](SjicdfU.webp) in anticipation of New Year's Resolution dieters.
- Sent a W9 to my writer.

## Misc

- Spent holidays with friends and family
- Updated the [Sia Docker image](https://www.github.com/mtlynch/docker-sia) to [1.4.2.0](https://hub.docker.com/layers/mtlynch/sia/1.4.2.0/images/sha256-99033eb5d4da611d69d68335ea3c19fe814f63ccaeec66d58bb95b56d5c0d109)
