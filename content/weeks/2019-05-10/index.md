## New project research

- Did site visits + gift dropoffs to two Goshen stone quarries
  - They're still not that enthusiastic about talking to me
- Follow up calls with two Goshen stone quarries
- Met with a professional copywriter about her workflow and pain points
- Set up a meeting with a third copywriter
- Made a [mockup](BpI50rF.webp) of what I have in mind as a tool for reviewing copy

## [What Got Done App](https://whatgotdone.com)

- Added a [navbar](epkIIz1.webp)
- Added a page showing [recent entries](http://www.whatgotdone.com/recent)
  - Still needs lots of UI work
- Improved the UI flow so now something actually happens after you successfully log in or submit an entry
  - Previously, you just sat on the page and had to know which URL to go to next
- Added separate Firebase and UserKit configurations for dev and production
- Added a homepage
- Added Google Analytics tracking

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Published my [monthly retrospective for April ](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2019/05/)
- Realized almost all of my pages had extraneous frontmatter
  - [Removing extraneous frontmatter sections from posts](https://github.com/mtlynch/mtlynch.io/pull/408)

## Beekeeping

- Had a bit of a scare because I thought my queens left, but a more experienced beekeeper showed me that they were just hiding
- They're making great progress on comb-building and both queens are laying healthy eggs
