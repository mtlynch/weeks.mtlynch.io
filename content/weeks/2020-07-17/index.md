## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com)

- Conducted two customer interviews
  - Reached out to 5-6 other local IT shops who didn't respond
- [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot/pull/62) where holding down a modifier key (e.g., Ctrl or Shift) would be treated like sending the key repeatedly
- Fired the logo designer I hired last week
  - They submitted sketches that were much worse than the samples they sent me from their portfolio when I was interviewing.
  - I reverse image searched the samples and realized that they were plagiarized
- Hired a new logo designer and reviewed their concept sketches
- Captured updated screenshots and live clips
- [Upgraded uStreamer dependency](https://github.com/mtlynch/ansible-role-tinypilot/pull/15) to v1.1.9
- [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/mtlynch/ansible-role-ustreamer/pull/5) in ansible-role-ustreamer that caused it to build corrupted binaries during version upgrades.
- Published [assembly instructions](https://tinypilotkvm.com/assembly/v1/)

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Continued writing my making-of post about TinyPilot

## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Discovered that one of the merchants I've been promoting [has been ripping me off](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/hsfaq7/how_to_deal_with_merchant_who_is_defrauding/)
  - I ended up emailing the CEO demanding payment, so we'll see how that goes.
  - Dropped the merchant from the newsletter and buried any pages mentioning them on the website so that you have to search for them specifically
- Refreshed Amazon affiliate links to make sure I was linking to related products that are still available and for sale
- Fixed some broken/missing internal links

## [Portfolio Rebalancer](https://assetrebalancer.com)

_This is still relegated to hobby project, but I'm trying to get it to the point where it automates my personal rebalancing strategy._

- Added support for multi-account portfolios
  - [Before](84jj.webp)
  - [After](NfHK.webp)
  - Still needs a bit of work. I'd like to get to the point where I can have per-account options
    - e.g., never sell any holdings in this account - only add investments
- Got import from CSV working, just need to polish the UI

## [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

- Checked in on my Enterprise customer
  - Looks like they're switching to pay-as-you go after this week since they completed their bulk parsing.

## [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org)

_In an effort to help Gridsome improve dev velocity, I've been volunteering a few hours a week to help [manage their documentation](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome.org)._

- Reviewed 5 PRs
- Added two new linter rules/consistency fixes

## Misc

- Did my bookkeeping for June
- Cleaned my bathroom vent fan
  - Apparently, they're a [common cause of fires](https://www.amfam.com/resources/articles/at-home/bathroom-exhaust-fan-fire-prevention)
