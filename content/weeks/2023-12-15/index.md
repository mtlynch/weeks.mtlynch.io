## [PicoShare](https://pico.rocks)

_PicoShare is a minimalist web-based file sharing tool I’m working on. I’m often frustrated that I can’t just send someone a link directly to a file because every file-sharing service tries to re-encode images/video or wrap their own viewer around other files, so I’m making a simple self-hostable tool that lets you upload files and share them with other people._

- Fixed a bug that prevented the release `.tar.gz` packages from [really being gzipped](https://github.com/mtlynch/picoshare/pull/522)

## [resticpy](https://github.com/mtlynch/resticpy)

## Misc

- Co-hosted Indie Founders meetup
- Visited friends/family out of state for the weekend
- Researched CO2 monitors
  - It seems like CO2 concentration is negatively correlated with cognitive function, so it seems useful to monitor it.
  - I was looking at [Aranet4 Home](https://shop.aranet.com/north-america/product/aranet4-home), which seems to have positive reviews and is small and looks good.
  - Then, I found [AirGradient ONE](https://www.airgradient.com/indoor/#comparison), which seems appealing because it's indie hardware and open-source like TinyPilot
    - But then I looked closer at the documentation, and it seems pretty bad.
    - It doesn't look very easy to adjust the code or pull in updates from upstream
  - Now, I'm stuck between Aranet and AirGradient
- Topped up car tires
  - They lose pressure when it gets colder
- Did holiday shopping
