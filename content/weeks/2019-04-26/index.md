## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Continued working on Hello World Cypress post
- Reached out to Cypress team for review of an early draft
- Fixed a regression I introduced when I migrated from Travis to CircleCI
  - I forgot to include the step of compiling the JS file for the site
  - [Fix part 1](https://github.com/mtlynch/mtlynch.io/pull/399)
  - [Fix part 2](https://github.com/mtlynch/mtlynch.io/pull/400)
- Removed old hobby projects from my [projects page](https://mtlynch.io/projects/)

## Planning for next project

- Emailed a few companies about creating an editing tool (no responses)
  - freeCodeCamp
  - HackerRank
  - CopyHackers

## [KetoHub](https://ketohub.io)

- Pitched a licensing deal to someone who wants to reimplement KetoHub's functionality
  - Seems like it's going to be a "no."

## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- $50 in revenue for the month so far
  - Already my biggest revenue month with me doing almost nothing

## Beekeeping

- [Built bee hives](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5EbuPE5r7zfuaAcZ9)
- Painted bee hives
- Built bee stand
- Buried ground rods for bear fence
- Got an external electrical outlet installed for bear fence

## Misc

- Figured out how to use [microplane](https://github.com/Clever/microplane) to make bulk, repetitive changes across Github repos (e.g., upgrading a package that I use in many projects)
  - It's decent. It's designed for a narrow scenario that Clever uses for a larger, so it's klunky to adapt it for me as a single developer, but it's better than doing it the manual way
  - Updated pylint, DocStringChecker, YAPF, and pyflakes on almost all of my Python projects
- Got my [Python 3 boilerplate project](https://github.com/mtlynch/python3_seed) to actually work
- Tried out Xero for bookkeeping
  - Oy, why are all the self-serve options terrible?
