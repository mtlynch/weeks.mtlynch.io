- Published my [August retrospective](https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2019/09/)

## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Continued processing applications for freelance writers from job postings I made at local colleges:
  - 12 new applicants
  - Reviewed articles from two applicants I hired last week. Decided not to move forward with one, continuing the trial with the other.
  - Hired a new writer on a trial basis
  - Extended an offer to a fourth writer on a trial basis
- Added article on [Green Beans](https://isitketo.org/green-beans)
- Tested out [Clockify](https://clockify.me/) as a way to track my freelancers' hours
  - Seems like a dud. I found it really confusing.
  - I looked for other solutions, but they're all expensive and/or overly complicated, so I'm sticking with shared Google Sheets
- Fixed my meal plan affiliate link
  - I was accidentally sending about 50% of referrals without getting credit
  - Luckily, the link has only been live for a week.
- Removed the [social share buttons](/2019-08-23/V4Sy8oJ.webp) I added [a few weeks ago](/2019-08-23/)
  - In the last two weeks, they only had three total clicks
- Removed cooking product recommendations
  - For keto-friendly foods, Is It Keto shows links where you can buy it on Amazon. For the last few months, I changed behavior so that if there was nothing related to buy on Amazon (e.g., you wouldn't buy lettuce on Amazon), Is It Keto recommended cooking products and keto cookbooks.
  - I checked my Amazon Affiliate history, and the revenue from sales on these unrelated products is so low that it's not worth showing the ads

## [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com)

- Fixed a bug in the CSRF mitigation feature

## [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

- Cold outreach to six prospective customers
- Pinged a recent customer who's gone radio silent

## [Dusty VCR](https://dustyvcr.com)

- Had hosts meeting
- Booked guests for episodes #11 and #12

## Beekeeping

- Did a full inspection of one hive
  - Got stung again and my foot swelled up (womp!). I had a full bee suit on with hiking boots, but they got me through my sock.
- Did a mite test on one of my hives and got 2 mites from 300 bees (healthy levels)
- Bought insulation to help winterize the hives

## Misc

- Continued building my home gym by finding a squat rack on Facebook marketplace and ordering rubber flooring from Amazon

## Goals for next week

- Continue working on affiliate pages on Is It Keto
- Finish open-sourcing What Got Done
