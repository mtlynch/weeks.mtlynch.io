## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

- Signed up for keto-related affiliate programs as a possible other monetization channels for Is It Keto
- Re-did the navbar so that it's more like a standard bootstrap navbar with room for more links
  - Before and after
    - [Mobile](JNsRQvb.webp)
    - [Desktop](z4YoocW.webp)
  - This has the side benefit of making it easier to jump between food category pages from the navbar
- In upgrading my Bootstrap library to fix the navbar, I accidentally messed up my food cards, so I spent some time fixing the regression there
  - Nice benefit is that I simplified my card HTML and made it more like the vanilla Bootstrap card template, so hopefully fewer regressions/surprises in the future
- Posted job listings for a freelance writer on several local college job boards
  - Got lots of responses
  - Hired two writers on a trial basis
- Added an [affiliate link](http://isitketo.org/meal-plans/) to a keto meal planning service
  - This page needs more work.
- Drafted a freelance writing contract (probably should have done this in the past)
  - I used [this template](https://www.docracy.com/0vc0u7keb75/work-for-hire-freelance-writing-master-agreement), but I found Docracy sort of klunky to use.
- My first [guest post](https://fitnesstogether.com/northampton/blog/five-benefits-of-health-training) linking back to Is It Keto got published.
- Added a new article
  - [Nutella](https://isitketo.org/nutella)
- Added some missing photos to Is It Keto
  - There were a few foods where I couldn't find royalty-free photos online, so I just took pictures at the supermarket.
  - You can see my excellent photography at:
    - [Jicama](http://isitketo.org/jicama)
    - [Yams](http://isitketo.org/yams)
    - [Spaghetti Squash](http://isitketo.org/spaghetti-squash)
- Added a bunch of manual redirects for when users search for something that's actually a category
  - e.g., [https://isitketo.org/vegetables](https://isitketo.org/vegetables) now redirects to [https://isitketo.org/category/vegetables/](https://isitketo.org/category/vegetables/) when previously it 404'ed
- Added the [outbound link tracking library](https://github.com/googleanalytics/autotrack) for Google Analytics
  - It looks like absolutely nobody is using the social sharing links I added last week
- Ignored [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/isitketo)
  - Currently at 14 pins (+0 from last week) and 23 followers (+1 from last week)

## [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com)

_Continued prepping the What Got Done repo for open-sourcing._

- I [mentioned What Got Done in a Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20795693), and led to a [big jump in signups](mCnHsDr.webp) (probably single-day record)
  - Though none of the new users have posted yet. Hello, new users! ðŸ‘‹
- Recreated my dev environment from scratch and documented everything needed to do it
- Converted all my command examples from PowerShell to bash
- Removed my hardcoded GCP project ID from source
- Added documentation for my authentication and datastore packages
- Realized a simpler way of integrating with the UserKit widget without spamming the server with lots of XHRs.

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Continued my guide to hiring content writers

## [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

- Responded to a previous customer interested in volume pricing (haven't heard back yet)

## [Dusty VCR](https://dustyvcr.com)

- Published [episode #10 - _The Wedding Singer_ with Matt Kantrowitz](https://dustyvcr.com/10-the-wedding-singer/)

## Beekeeping

- Went to an allergist to see if I'm allergic to my bees because last time I got stung, I had an insanely itchy reaction (fortunately nothing life-threatening)
  - Sounds like I'm at low risk of anaphylaxis, but I got an epipen anyway and _wow_ are they expensive.
  - My insurance doesn't cover epipens, so my out of pocket cost would have been $380 for a two-pack that needs replacement every year
  - GoodRx claimed I could get it with a coupon at Walgreens for $147, but Walgreens said the coupon only brought it down to $260, so I just sucked it up and bought it.
- Rendered some more beeswax
- Shipped out some honey to family and early customers

## Misc

- [Proofread a Python e2e testing tutorial](https://github.com/AndyLPK247/djangocon-2019-web-ui-testing/pull/1) for [Andy Knight](https://automationpanda.com/)
- Got a great deal through craigslist on an Olympic weight set for my home gym ($100 for 410 lbs of nice plates and an Olympic bar!)
- Prepped my lawnmower and weedwacker for sale on Craigslist
  - I switched to a lawn service and they're just taking up space in my garage

## Goals for next week

- Publish an August retrospective on [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)
- Continue working on affiliate pages on Is It Keto
- Finish open-sourcing What Got Done
