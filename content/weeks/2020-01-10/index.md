## [WanderJest](http://wanderjest.com)

- Commissioned a logo from a local comic/designer and went through a few revisions
  - Logo is 99% done, so I expect to have it up next week.
- Talked to a local comedy theater who's interested in a partnership.
  - Made a private preview version of the website to demonstrate the idea and sent it to them. Waiting to hear back.
- Added rich comedian profiles with photos and real bios:
  - Comedian Page: [before](T2mHYPY.webp) vs [after](gw5yF5G.webp)
  - Browse page: [before](waewjYT.webp) vs. [after](ya8Q2C0.webp)
- I spent like an hour trying to find a royalty-free cartoon I could use to represent missing profiles before finally giving up and making [my own glorious one](3J18bPl.webp)
- Added [Typeform links](czG7ARF.webp) so comedians can submit their own shows and profiles
  - So far 0 users have submitted either, so I need to rethink things.
  - Talked to one comedian who said that he was discouraged by the amount of work required up-front to modify the profile.
  - I think there's a lack of incentive because nobody has any evidence that putting information on WanderJest will benefit them.
  - I'm considering adding simple analytics (e.g., hit counter) so that people see how many people are visiting their pages.
  - I pre-populated a bunch of comedians' names when I launched the site because I was hoping they'd be flattered to find themselves on the site and want to participate, but that might have been the wrong approach. People might have been more enticed to submit if they didn't already have a placeholder profile. The better approach might be to hide listings for anyone who doesn't have a profile.
  - I'm also going to create more comedian profiles myself for the most popular comedians as a way to encourage others to follow suit.
- Continued conversations with a business interested in advertising, but they've been delayed in getting back to me.
- Attended a comedy open mic and interviewed three comedians / show hosts.
- Added more granular venue information so that now the show cards display the city: PnFdhbE.webp

## [mtlynch.io](https://mtlynch.io)

- Completed my [migration from Jekyll to Hugo](https://twitter.com/deliberatecoder/status/1213965436095803392).
- Wrote a spec for the cartoon to accompany my next blog post.
- Started putting together my "Year Two as a Solo Developer" post.
- Someone submitted my last monthly retrospective to Hacker News, and it [made reached the front page](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21990409)
  - It's funny because I tried so hard to get on HN with [the last eight articles](https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=mtlynch.io) on my main blog and none of them got any traction. This post took 1/10th the time and made it to the top without me even submitting it.
