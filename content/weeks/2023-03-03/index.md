_Short update, as I was traveling in Europe_

## [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com)

- Met with punkt.de, TinyPilot's EU distributor in person
- Visited the Karlsruhe Castle
- Met one of TinyPilot's developers in Berlin
- Had lunch and went axe throwing with TinyPilot's support engineers in London

## Misc

- Screwed up planning for a Blogging for Devs meetup
  - I planned four months in advance to meet up with the Blogging for Devs members in Berlin
  - I showed up the night of the meetup to find nobody there
  - I called Monica Lent, the founder and organizer of the meetup, who reminded me that I said I'd be in Berlin on March 3rd and it was currently March 1st ðŸ˜•
  - Fortunately, Monica came out to get pizza with me on very short notice, so I at least got to finally meet her in person after speaking with her online for a couple of years
- Saw the play [_2:22 A Ghost Story_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2:22_A_Ghost_Story)
  - It was okay. I didn't like the characters that much, but it's been a long time since I've seen live theater, and this was right across the street from my hotel.
