## [fusion](https://github.com/0x2E/fusion)

_fusion is an open-source RSS reader I found when looking for an RSS aggregator to host on my NixOS system. I like that it's written in Go and uses SQLite as a backend, so it's pretty easy to self-host. The maintainer is very responsive to PRs as well._

## [PicoShare](https://pico.rocks)

_PicoShare is a minimalist web-based file sharing tool I'm working on. I'm often frustrated that I can't just send someone a link directly to a file because every file-sharing service tries to re-encode images/video or wrap their own viewer around other files, so I'm making a simple self-hostable tool that lets you upload files and share them with other people._
